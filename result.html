	<strong>Triple P�s top tips for a stress-free transition to school</strong>

	<li><strong>Plan new routines in advance</strong></li>

	<li>
		The shift back-to-school means earlier wake-up times and longer, busier
		days for the entire family. Plan for this by getting everyone into a
		routine in advance, including adjusting kids� nighttime routines in the
		week before school goes back.
	</li>
	<li>
		Save time and stress in the morning by prepping lunches or snacks the
		night before and leave time to unwind in the first few weeks back �
		don�t overcommit to activities.
	</li>
	<li>
		Involve kids in making decisions about their new routine to help them
		feel less stressed. This improves their coping skills. For example,
		something as simple as letting them pick their lunches for the week will
		give them a sense of ownership and enthusiasm.
